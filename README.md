## E-commmerce API

* This is a just a simple project that I wanted to learn to create something basic in go 
* My intention is just to learn and understand go better 
* I have no Idea how it might be better that other existing API's. 
* I take no credit of any code that is written in this repo.I am simply following other people's guide to do this.
